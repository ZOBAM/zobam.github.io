        <p>I have the following properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li id="elemID">Lands</li>
            <li class="elemClass">Houses</li>
            <li >Cars</li>
            <li class="anotherClass">Bikes</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="animate"> Trying out animation</div>
        <ol>
            <li>Lands</li>
            <li>Houses</li>
            <li>Cars</li>
            <li>Bikes</li>
        </ol>

                I have been thinking through the whole thing you told me this morning and I'm sad to let you know that I won't be able able to make it. My performance last week on the task and assignments given weren't so good and I was asked to repeat them coupled with the assignments of this week, all to be submitted on Saturday morning. As I face this strenuous training session, I don't want to create any impression that I am not fully committed to it because part of the terms is that I should be fully available always for the duration of the training without having other engagements with which I will give excuses or miss class.
            </p>

                Finally, I can't really wait to get to the point of even a little degree of financial ease so that I can really live the life I yearn to live, a live of constant service and work in His vineyard for the expansion of the Kingdom. I feel so bad whenever I have to write you messages like this but for now, it seems I have little or no choice. 

                Please sir, don't forget to pray for me.
