		I have taken note of what is happening recently both in the spirit realm and in the physical world and there is a great need that I talk to you.
		You have to be strong, yes, you have to. Don't give up yet for THIS IS NOT THE END!
		This that now looks like utter failure and a ruined life will yet turn out good. Our God will work it out for your good.
		Your struggles are not unknown to your heavenly Father and He has put that burden on my spirit this morning to encourage you.
		Be strong, beloved be strong for the night is almost over. 
		May the Lord ease your pains and cause the heavy loads to fall off your shoulders in Jesus name! I command the grip of the devil over your life and affairs to be broken by the power in the name of Jesus Christ!
